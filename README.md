# Yoda metadata editor open access
The yoda-metadata-editor branch consists of files that allow the Yoda metadata fields to be filled in by people that are not 
using Yoda, but still want or need a graphical user interface to fill in metadata for their own data package. 

For those already storing data within Yoda at their own institute, it is essential to fill in the metadata within the Yoda platform being used alongside the data that is stored within Yoda. 

For those not storing data in Yoda, this Yoda metadata editor is available on https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/yoda-portal/.

The fields of the yoda metadata editor are based on the DataCite metadata schema https://schema.datacite.org/. The full schema employed is 
visible at https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/yoda-ruleset/tree/development/schemas (the highest number of the 'default' schema). A full explanation of the terms used is present at https://www.uu.nl/en/research/yoda/guide-to-yoda/i-am-using-yoda/documenting-your-data.

(Note that this branch can also be downloaded and run locally)
